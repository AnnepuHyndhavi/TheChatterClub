### php assignment

_The Chatter Club_ is a basic social networking site that enables the users to signup to create an account and login whenever required.
<br> This website has the features to 
* add friends
* search for friends using
  * email
  * hometown
  * name
  * posts
<br>
As of now the signup is not enables as it uses jquery and js for its functionality and as mentioned in the assignment submission guidelines,  https://learn.rtcamp.com/campus/php-assignments/guidelines/

I haven't included the js and jquery files for now. 
<br>
For the _database_, a table is created for the users to check their friendship staus, posts and the user mobile number i.e,,. incase the user wishes to share his/her/their number.
<br> phpmyadmin is used for the data storing purposes.
